WHAT?
- is a sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other nodes also containing data.
- every node has pointer to the next node. Last node point to null

WHERE are USED?
- Used in many List, Queue, and Stack implementations
- Great for creating circular lists
- Can easily model real world objects such as trains
- Used in seperate chaining, which is present certain Hashtable implementations to deal with hashing collisions.
- Often used in implementation of adjacent lists for graphs

			Pros 			vs 					Cons 
Singly	Uses less memory				Cannot easily access previous elements
											(need 2 trav for delete)
Doubly	Can be tranversed bacwards		Take 2x memory


COMPLEXITY

					Singly		vs		Doubly
Search				O(n)				O(n)
Insert at Head 		O(1)				O(1)
Inser at Tail		O(1)				O(1)
Remove at Head		O(1)				O(1)
Remove at Tail		O(n)				O(1)
Remove in middle	O(n)				O(n)
