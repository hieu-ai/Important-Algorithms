Implementing Dynamic Array:
- create static array
- add element and keep track length
- if exceed capacity -> create new array with twice the capacity and copy the original elements to the new one

Complexity:
			Static  Dynamic
Access: 	O(1)	O(1)
Search: 	O(n)	O(n)
Insertion:	N/A 	O(n)
Appending: 	N/A 	O(1)
Delete:		N/A 	O(n)
